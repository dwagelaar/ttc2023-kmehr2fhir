	abstract = {To cope with the increased complexity, models are used to capture what is considered the essence of a system. Models are often analyzed to obtain insights on the modeled system. Often, these analyses have a heuristical nature and need to be adjusted according to updated requirements and are therefore a subject of maintenance activities. It is thus necessary to support writing model queries with adequate languages. However, in order to stay meaningful, the analysis results need to be refreshed as soon as the underlying models change. Therefore, a good execution speed is mandatory in order to cope with frequent model changes. In this paper, we propose a benchmark to assess model query technologies in the presence of model change sequences in the domain of social media.},

	url = {https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2026/paper1.pdf},
	abstract = {To cope with the increased complexity, physical systems are more and more supported by software systems consisting of multiple subsystems. Usually, each of the subsystems uses standards relevant to the subsystem for interoperability with other tools. Thus, one faces the problem that information about the system as a whole is distributed across multiple models. To solve this problem, model views can be introduced to combine these models and extract application-speciﬁc knowledge. As an example, the smart grid is a cyber-physical system where one is interested to detect, manage and prevent system outages. The information necessary to do this is split among the standards IEC 61970/61968, IEC 61850 and IEC 62056. This paper presents a benchmark case and evaluation framework for joining information spread across multiple models into a single view, based on a model-based outage management system for smart grids. Because cyber-physical systems often require very fast response times to changes of underlying models, the benchmark focuses especially on the incremental computation of model views.},

The case is aimed at the production of high-quality designs for object-oriented systems and presents the problem of ﬁnding a good class diagram for a given set of methods and attributes with functional and data relationships among them. In order to obtain such a class diagram, dedicated quality metrics that have been deﬁned in the context of the class responsibility assignment problem need to be optimized. Therefore, the focus of this case study is not on the deﬁnition of the necessary set of rules, but rather on the orchestration of such rules in order to ﬁnd the optimal class diagrams. The evaluation of the produced transformation is driven by the quality of the produced models, the complexity of the rule orchestration as well as by the ﬂexibility of the solution and its performance.},
